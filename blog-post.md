**Portland, OR** 
Today is Friday at SibCode. We learned a lot about git, github, and Markdown. Here is a quote from [Epicodus](learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/markdown) that I found helpful.

>Remember Markdown is a way to format text to be viewed in a browser, but we can also add in active links to image files, video files, and other web pages. The page you are currently looking at is written in Markdown.
